            <h3>About</h3>
            <p class="summary">
                I am a current undergraduate student studying Applied Mathematics and Computer Science at
                University of California, Berkeley. I am passionate about data science with a focus on
                deep learning and computer vision with convolutional neural networks, and I enjoy learning
                applied topics in linear algebra, differential equations, and vector calculus.
                I aim to pursue a career that involves designing novel machine and deep learning methodologies
                to solve real-world challenges.

                    I worked with Singapore's Ministry of Health, Office of Healthcare Transformation (MOHT)
                    to research posts in MOHT's mental health forum, specifically to discover themes and topics
                    discussed by users. Topic modeling algorithms researched include Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA),
                    Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF), Top2Vec, and BERTopic. A novel clustering method was
                    proposed to account for the stochastic nature of BERTopic, the best performing algorithm on our dataset.
                    A comparative analysis between mental health posts on MOHT's forum, Reddit, and HardwareZone (Singaporean forum)
                    was performed to discover insights into similarities and differences based on type of forum and demographics.

                    The end goal is to combine methods for active fire detection, burned area segmentation, and
                    smoke detection to devise a single deep learning model for simulateous prediction of
                    in all three aspects. Current progress includes a well-performing baseline U-Net for burned area

                    We also use an API to generate and display famous motivational quotes on the home page.

                    (GAMs) and Random Forest models to make predictions using Python tools. Random Forest was also
                    used to assess variable importance, where the variables included climate and oceanographic predictors
                    that influence the growth of salmon.
